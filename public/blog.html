                    <li>When a component is unmounted, useEffect can be used to clean up after it.</li>
                    <li>When a component updates, useEffect can be used to start animations or transitions.
                    </li>
                    <li>After a component has rendered, useEffect can be used to update the DOM.</li>

            <h1>4. How does React Work?</h1>
            <h3>React is a JavaScript library used to create user interfaces. It makes effective use of a virtual DOM
                (Document Object
                Model) to refresh the UI in response to changes in user interactions. To manage state and data, it also
                employs a component-based architecture and a unidirectional data flow.
